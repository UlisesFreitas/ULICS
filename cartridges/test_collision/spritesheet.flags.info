# Sprite Flags File for test_collision
# This file stores the 8-bit flag values for each of the 256 sprites
# Format: One byte per sprite (0-255), total 256 bytes

# Sprite 0: Player (FLAG 0 = bit 0 = value 1)
# Sprite 1: Brown Platform (FLAG 1 = bit 1 = value 2)
# All other sprites: No flags (value 0)

# The actual binary file will be created by the Sprite Editor
# when you save with Ctrl+S after using fset() in Lua
